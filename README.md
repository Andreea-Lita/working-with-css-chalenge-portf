# Working-with-css-chalenge-portf about own portfolio projects 
This page is to start building your own portfolio as an example!!

 ## Own portfolio code accessibility development requirements
In order for a person to develop a portfolio in order to do the desired work, he must comply with some criteria for the presentation of the page that highlights it, namely:
*to display the name, a representative picture and links to about her, her profile and contact details;
*take the links to the appropriate department;
*the corresponding sections should have pictures with titles and likes for the respective project;
*possibly, the page can be adapted to different devices.

### Technical functionality improved by me:
*I added representative heading;
*I added about me, work, and contact sections with pictures;
*Application's links are functional;
*Application's CSS structure is following a natural logic order;
